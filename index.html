        <h2>Three Fast Facts</h2>
        <br>
        <ol>
          <li>The US makes up only 5% of the world population, but it throws away enough plastic bottles in a week to encircle the Earth 5 times!</li>
          <li>The U.S. is the #1 trash-producing country in the world at 1,609 pounds per person per year. This means that 5% of the world’s people generate 40% of the world’s waste. We toss out two billion plastic razors, a million and a half tons of paper towels, and 12 billion disposable diapers annually.</li>
          <li>The average college student produces 640 pounds of solid waste each year, including 500 disposable cups and 320 pounds of paper.</li>
        </ol>
